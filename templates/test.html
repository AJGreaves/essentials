            <p>Now that you have learned about the title element, let's play around with placing it correctly within the
                structure of the other elements you have worked with so far. </p>

            <p>Instructions:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Add the <strong>html</strong>, <strong>head</strong> and <strong>body</strong> blocks as you did
                    before. Making sure to nest the head and body blocks are inside the html block.</li>
                <li>Nest the <strong>title block</strong> within the head block.</li>
                <li>Using the block with quotation marks in it, add the <strong>text</strong> content “Coders
                    Coffeehouse” to the title block.</li>
            </ol>

            <p>Check out the html output to see how the structure of what you have built is translated into code.</p>

            <p>If you have arranged your elements correctly, the html output should look like this:</p>

            <div style="text-align: center;" class="mb-4">
                <img src="https://codeinstitute.s3.amazonaws.com/HTMLEssentials/html-essentials-1-first-look.png"
                    alt="Sample output from HTML First Look playground" />
            </div>

            <!-- Replace `src` with relevant URL here. If this is not the first iframe on the page, be sure to change the `id` to the relevant number -->
            <p><iframe id="iframe1"
                    src="https://code-institute-org.github.io/playground/playground.html?lang=html&blocks=html$head$body$title$plaintext"
                    width="1000px" height="550px" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
            <p></p>
            <!-- If this is not the first iframe on the page, update the this with the relevant iframe ID -->
            <p><button onclick="toggleFullScreen('iframe1')" class="fancy-button medium ci-special zoom">Expand<i
                        class="fa fa-arrows-alt"></i></button></p>
        </div>
    </div>

<p>Now lets write our first bit of code for the Coders Coffeehouse project. Below we have the basic structure for a html
    document. But we need to add a title element to the head so that the website name shows in the browser tab.</p>
<p>Using what you have learned above:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Add a <strong>title element</strong> inside the head element</li>
    <li>Inside the title element, add the text "Coders Coffeehouse"</li>
    <li>Click the Run button to see your code translated into a live page</li>
</ol>
