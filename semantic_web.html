                    <p><code>&lt;nav&gt;</code>
                        <br>The nav element represents a location on a page that links to other pages or
                        to parts within a page. It’s like a  section with navigation links.  Note though that not all
                        groups of links on a page need to be in a nav element - Only sections that consist of major
                        navigation blocks are appropriate for the <code>&lt;nav&gt;</code> element.</p>

                <div class="col-12 col-md-6">
                    <p><code>&lt;main&gt;</code>
                        <br>The main can be used only once per page. It contains the main
                        content of the page outside of the page-level heading and footer. It should not have content
                        that is repeated across the pages, such as; links, logo, copyright. It should only have material
                        that is unique to the current page.</p>

                <div class="col-12 col-md-6">
                    <p><code>&lt;article&gt;</code>
                        <br> The article element represents an independent piece of content. That is
                        content that makes sense on its own. An article could be a blog post, a magazine or newspaper
                        article, a user-submitted comment, an interactive widget, or any other independent item of
                        content. The content of an article could be distributed and understood outside the context of
                        the page</p>
                </div>
                <div class="col-12 col-md-6">
                    <p><code>&lt;section&gt;</code>
                        <br> The section element is used to represent a group of related content. A
                        section is similar to the purpose of an <code>&lt;article&gt;</code> element with the main
                        difference being that the content within a &lt;section&gt; element doesn’t necessarily need to
                        make sense out of the context of the page. A Web site's home page could be split into sections
                        for an introduction, news items, and contact information. Sections could define newspapers
                        section summaries and links to sports, current affairs, lifestyle, politics and arts reviews.

                <div class="col-12 col-md-6">
                    <p><code>&lt;aside&gt;</code>
                        <br>When used within an <code>&lt;article&gt;</code> element,
                        the contents af an aside element should be specifically related to that article (e.g., a glossary). When used
                        outside of an <code>&lt;article&gt;</code> element, the contents should be related to the site
                        (e.g., a twitter feed, groups of additional navigation, and even advertising if that content is
                        related to the page)</p>

                        <br>The figure element </p>
                </div>
                <div class="col-12 col-md-6">

                        <br></p>

                <div class="col-12 col-md-6">
                    <p><code>&lt;footer&gt;</code>
                        <br> The footer element works in very much the same way as the
                        <code>&lt;header&gt;</code> element. A footer typically
                        contains information about each section such as who wrote it, links to related documents,
                        copyright data, and the like.</p>

<p>
    Think of an <code>&lt;article&gt;</code> element like an article in a news website that 
    details a specific news item. This article can be read and understood without needing to
    read other things on the same page. An article would have a title and brief introduction, 
    both of which could be nested inside a <code>&lt;header&gt;</code> element to add 
    additional context to the browser and search engines.
